# OLC-DataScience-Churn
This is a public repository consisting of my notebook about predicting Churn rate as a part of OLC 2023 Data Science workshop last December. The main goal was to predict whether a customer is going to churn or not (binary classification). I used a random forest model (with undersampling) in this notebook and got a very good accuracy score (~99%).
